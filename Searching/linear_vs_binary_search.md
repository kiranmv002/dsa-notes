Linear Search vs Binary Search

Both Linear Search and Binary Search are used to find an element in a list,
but they work in different ways.

Linear Search:
- Checks each element one by one
- Works on both sorted and unsorted data
- Easy to understand and implement
- Slow for large data

Binary Search:
- Divides the list into halves
- Works only on sorted data
- Faster than linear search
- Slightly complex compared to linear search

Comparison Table:

Linear Search
- Order required: No
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Approach: Sequential checking

Binary Search
- Order required: Yes (sorted)
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Approach: Divide and conquer

Conclusion:
Linear Search is suitable for small or unsorted data.
Binary Search is better for large and sorted datasets.
