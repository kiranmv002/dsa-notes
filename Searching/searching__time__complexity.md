Time Complexity in Searching

Time complexity tells how much time an algorithm takes
based on the size of the input.

Understanding time complexity helps in choosing
the right algorithm for a problem.

Linear Search Time Complexity

Best Case:
- Element found at the first position
- Time Complexity: O(1)

Average Case:
- Element found somewhere in the middle
- Time Complexity: O(n)

Worst Case:
- Element found at last position or not present
- Time Complexity: O(n)

Binary Search Time Complexity

Best Case:
- Element found at the middle position
- Time Complexity: O(1)

Average Case:
- Search space reduces step by step
- Time Complexity: O(log n)

Worst Case:
- Element found after dividing multiple times
- Time Complexity: O(log n)

Important Note:
Binary Search is faster than Linear Search,
but it works only on sorted data.

Conclusion:
- Linear Search is simple but slow for large data
- Binary Search is efficient for large and sorted datasets
