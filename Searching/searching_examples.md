Searching Examples

Examples help in understanding how searching algorithms work in real cases.

Example 1: Linear Search

Array: [8, 3, 6, 2, 9]
Target: 6

Process:
- Start from first element
- 8 → not match
- 3 → not match
- 6 → match found

Result:
Element found at index 2

Example 2: Binary Search

Sorted Array: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Target: 8

Process:
- Middle element is 6 → target is greater
- Move to right half
- Middle element is 8 → match found

Result:
Element found at index 3

Conclusion:
Examples make it easier to understand the working of searching algorithms.
