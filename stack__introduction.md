Stack Introduction

A Stack is a linear data structure.
It follows the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO).

This means the element added last
will be removed first.

Basic Operations:

- Push: Add an element to the stack
- Pop: Remove the top element from the stack
- Peek: View the top element


Example:

Stack elements: [10, 20, 30]

Push 40 → [10, 20, 30, 40]
Pop → removes 40
Stack becomes: [10, 20, 30]

Applications of Stack:
- Undo and redo operations
- Function calls
- Expression evaluation

Stack is easy to understand and widely used in programming.
