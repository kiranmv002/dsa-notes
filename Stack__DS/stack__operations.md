Stack Operations

Stack supports a few basic operations
that help in storing and accessing data.

Push Operation:
- Adds an element to the top of the stack

Example:
Initial Stack: [10, 20]
Push 30
Stack becomes: [10, 20, 30]

Pop Operation:
- Removes the top element from the stack

Example:
Initial Stack: [10, 20, 30]
Pop
Stack becomes: [10, 20]

Peek Operation:
- Returns the top element without removing it

Example:
Top element is 20

These operations follow the LIFO principle
(Last In, First Out).
