Stack Summary

A Stack is a linear data structure
that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
The element added last is the first one to be removed.

How it works:
- All operations are performed at one end called the top
- Elements are added using push operation
- Elements are removed using pop operation

Topics Covered in Stack:
- Stack Introduction
- Stack Operations (Push, Pop, Peek)
- Stack Implementation using Array
- Stack Implementation using Linked List
- Applications of Stack
- Stack Time Complexity

Example:
Stack operations sequence:

Push 10 → Stack: [10]
Push 20 → Stack: [10, 20]
Pop → removes 20 → Stack: [10]

Key Points:
- Stack is simple and efficient
- Insertion and deletion take constant time
- Used in function calls, undo/redo, and expression evaluation

Conclusion:
Stack is an important data structure
used in both system-level and application-level programming.
