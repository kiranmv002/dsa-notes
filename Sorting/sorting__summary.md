Sorting Summary

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data
in a specific order, usually ascending or descending.

Algorithms Covered:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

Key Points:
- Bubble Sort is easy but inefficient for large datasets
- Selection Sort performs the same in all cases
- Insertion Sort works well for small or nearly sorted data

Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends
on the size and nature of the data.

This summary gives a quick overview of basic sorting concepts.
