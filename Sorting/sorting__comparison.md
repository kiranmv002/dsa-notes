Sorting Algorithms Comparison

Different sorting algorithms have different performance
based on data size and order.

Bubble Sort:
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements
- Easy to understand
- Slow for large datasets
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

Selection Sort:
- Selects the smallest element and places it correctly
- Simple logic
- Performance does not improve for sorted data
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

Insertion Sort:
- Inserts elements into their correct position
- Efficient for small or nearly sorted data
- Faster than Bubble and Selection in such cases
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

Comparison Summary:
- Bubble Sort → Very simple, least efficient
- Selection Sort → Fewer swaps, still slow
- Insertion Sort → Best among basic sorting algorithms

Conclusion:
Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends
on data size and how sorted the data already is.
