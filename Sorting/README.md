Sorting Notes

Sorting is used to arrange data in a specific order, usually ascending or descending.
This repository is created to store simple and easy-to-understand notes on sorting algorithms.

Topics Covered

• Bubble Sort – Basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements.

• Selection Sort – Sorting technique that selects the smallest element and places it in order.

• Insertion Sort – Sorting by inserting elements into their correct position.

More sorting algorithms will be added as learning continues.
