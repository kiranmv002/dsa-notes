Sorting Examples

Examples help in understanding how sorting algorithms
work step by step.

Example : Bubble Sort

Array: [4, 1, 3, 2]

Step 1:
Compare 4 and 1 → swap → [1, 4, 3, 2]

Step 2:
Compare 4 and 3 → swap → [1, 3, 4, 2]

Step 3:
Compare 4 and 2 → swap → [1, 3, 2, 4]

Final Result:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Example 2: Insertion Sort

Array: [6, 2, 5, 1]

Step 1:
Sorted part: [6]

Step 2:
Insert 2 → [2, 6]

Step 3:
Insert 5 → [2, 5, 6]

Step 4:
Insert 1 → [1, 2, 5, 6]

Final Result:
[1, 2, 5, 6]

Conclusion:
Examples make sorting algorithms easier to understand.
