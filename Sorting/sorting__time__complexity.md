Sorting Time Complexity

Time complexity describes how the running time
of an algorithm grows with input size.

Understanding time complexity helps in selecting
the most efficient sorting algorithm.

Bubble Sort:
Best Case: O(n)  – when the array is already sorted
Worst Case: O(n²)

Selection Sort:
Best Case: O(n²)
Worst Case: O(n²)

Insertion Sort:
Best Case: O(n) – when the array is nearly sorted
Worst Case: O(n²)

Summary:
- Bubble Sort is simple but inefficient for large data
- Selection Sort has constant performance regardless of input order
- Insertion Sort performs better for small or nearly sorted data

Conclusion:
Time complexity is an important factor when choosing
a sorting algorithm for a problem.
