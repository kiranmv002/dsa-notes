Queue Summary

A Queue is a linear data structure
that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
The element added first is the first one to be removed.

How it works:
- Elements are inserted at the rear of the queue
- Elements are removed from the front of the queue
- FIFO order is always maintained

Topics Covered in Queue:
- Queue Introduction
- Queue Operations (Enqueue, Dequeue, Front)
- Queue Implementation using Array
- Queue Implementation using Linked List
- Applications of Queue
- Queue Time Complexity

Example:
Queue operations sequence:

Enqueue 10 → Queue: [10]
Enqueue 20 → Queue: [10, 20]
Dequeue → removes 10 → Queue: [20]

Key Points:
- Queue ensures ordered processing
- Insertion and deletion take constant time
- Used in scheduling, buffering, and BFS traversal

Conclusion:
Queue is an important data structure
used in many real-world and system-level applications.
