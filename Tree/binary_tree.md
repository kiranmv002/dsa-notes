Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure
in which each node can have at most two children.

These children are referred to as:
- Left Child
- Right Child

Binary Tree is one of the most commonly used
tree structures in Data Structures and Algorithms.

Basic Properties:
- Each node has at most two children
- Order of children matters (left and right)
- Can be empty or have one or more nodes

How it works:
- Data is stored in nodes
- Each node points to its left and right child
- Tree starts from a root node

Example:
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \
    D   E

Here:
- A is the root node
- B and C are children of A
- D and E are children of B

Types of Binary Tree:
- Full Binary Tree
- Complete Binary Tree
- Perfect Binary Tree

Applications of Binary Tree:
- Expression trees
- Hierarchical data representation
- Foundation for Binary Search Tree and Heap

Key Points:
- Binary Tree allows at most two children
- Very important for advanced tree concepts
- Used as a base for many algorithms

Binary Tree is a fundamental concept
that must be understood before learning tree traversals.
