Tree Introduction

A Tree is a non-linear data structure
used to store data in a hierarchical manner.

Unlike arrays and linked lists,
a tree organizes data in parent-child relationships.

Basic Terms:
- Root: The topmost node of the tree
- Parent: A node that has child nodes
- Child: A node connected below a parent
- Leaf Node: A node with no children
- Edge: Connection between two nodes

How it works:
- Data is stored in nodes
- Nodes are connected using edges
- The tree starts from a root node
- Each node can have multiple children

Example:
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \
    D   E

Here:
- A is the root node
- B and C are children of A
- D and E are children of B
- D, E, C are leaf nodes

Applications of Tree:
- File system hierarchy
- Database indexing
- Organization charts
- Decision making systems

Key Points:
- Tree is a hierarchical data structure
- Used when data has parent-child relationship
- Very important in Data Structures and Algorithms

Tree forms the base for advanced structures
like Binary Tree, BST, and Heap.
