Types of Trees

Trees can be classified into different types
based on their structure and usage.
Each type of tree is designed
to solve specific problems.

How it works:
- Data is stored in nodes
- Nodes are connected in a hierarchical structure
- The arrangement of nodes defines the type of tree

Types of Trees:

1. General Tree
- A node can have any number of children
- No specific ordering between children

Example:
        A
      / | \
     B  C  D

2. Binary Tree
- Each node can have at most two children
- Children are referred to as left and right child

Example:
        A
       / \
      B   C

3. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- A special type of binary tree
- Left child contains smaller values
- Right child contains larger values

4. Complete Binary Tree
- All levels are completely filled
- Last level is filled from left to right

5. Full Binary Tree
- Each node has either 0 or 2 children

Applications of Different Trees:
- Binary Trees are used in expression evaluation
- BST is used in searching and sorting
- Trees are used in file systems and databases

Key Points:
- Different trees serve different purposes
- Binary Tree is the most commonly used
- Tree type selection depends on the problem

Understanding tree types is important
before learning advanced tree operations.
