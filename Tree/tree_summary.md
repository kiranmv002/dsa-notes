Tree Summary

A Tree is a non-linear data structure
used to represent hierarchical relationships.

Unlike linear data structures,
trees organize data in parent-child form.

What We Learned:

- Tree Introduction and basic terminology
- Types of Trees
- Binary Tree
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Time Complexity of Tree operations

Important Concepts:

- Root, Parent, Child, Leaf Node
- Height of tree
- Balanced vs Skewed tree
- BST property
- Tree traversal techniques

Advantages of Tree:

- Represents hierarchical data efficiently
- Faster searching in balanced trees
- Foundation for advanced structures

Disadvantages of Tree:

- Can become slow if unbalanced
- Requires extra memory for pointers

Key Takeaways:

- Binary Tree is the base for advanced trees
- BST improves searching efficiency
- Performance depends on tree height
- Balanced trees are more efficient

Tree is one of the most important
data structures in DSA
and forms the foundation for
Heap, AVL Tree, and Graph concepts.
