Linked List Summary

A Linked List is a linear data structure
where elements are stored in nodes
and connected using links.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not
require contiguous memory locations.

What We Learned:
- Linked List introduction and structure
- Insertion and deletion operations
- Types of linked list
- Linked list implementation
- Applications of linked list
- Time complexity analysis

Key Takeaways:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Efficient insertion and deletion
- No direct access using index
- Traversal is required to access elements

Advantages:
- Flexible size
- Easy insertion and deletion
- Efficient memory usage

Disadvantages:
- Extra memory for pointers
- Slower access compared to arrays

Linked lists are best suited
when frequent insertions and deletions
are required and memory flexibility is important.
