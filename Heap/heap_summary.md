Heap Summary

Heap is a special type of Complete Binary Tree
that follows the Heap Property.

Types of Heap:

1. Max Heap
- Parent node is greater than or equal to its children
- Root contains the maximum value

2. Min Heap
- Parent node is smaller than or equal to its children
- Root contains the minimum value

What We Learned:

- Heap Introduction
- Heap Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Heapify)
- Heap Implementation using Array
- Min Heap vs Max Heap
- Heap Sort
- Time Complexity of Heap

Important Concepts:

- Complete Binary Tree
- Heap Property
- Heapify Up and Heapify Down
- Array representation of Heap
- Parent and Child index formulas

Time Complexity Overview:

- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)
- Heapify: O(log n)
- Build Heap: O(n)
- Access Root: O(1)

Advantages:

- Efficient for priority-based problems
- Fast access to max/min element
- Used in Heap Sort and Priority Queue

Disadvantages:

- Not suitable for searching arbitrary elements
- Not stable sorting (Heap Sort)

Key Takeaways:

- Heap is based on Binary Tree
- Implemented efficiently using arrays
- Used in many real-world applications
- Important for advanced algorithms

Heap is an essential data structure
in Data Structures and Algorithms.
